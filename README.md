These analysis scripts analyze the second study visit version of the All-Dressed Behavioural Task.

Run `SV_Plot_Behav_Data_Overall.m` by itself to analyze the effects of GVS on motor vigour, peak pressure and peak time without consideration of the effects of reward. Make sure you are connected to Teamshare before running the script.

Run the `SV_Behavioural_Analysis_Rewardwise(participant_id)` function to look at the effects of GVS and reward on motor vigour, peak pressure and peak time.
